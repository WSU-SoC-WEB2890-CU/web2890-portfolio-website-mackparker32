              <p>
                Iâ€™m in my fourth year of college, and I just switched my major
                to Web and User Experience a little over a year ago. Before, I
                was interested in becoming a graphic design student, but the
                coding world caught my eye. Since there is still a great deal of
                design in web development, I thought it would be a good mix of
                both worlds.
              </p>
              <p>
                So far, I find JavaScript really interesting and mess around
                with it in my spare time. I also like using Bootstrap in my
                projects. I recently got introduced to React.js and find it very
                appealing to use in future projects if there is any
                functionality needed.
